      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead text-muted">August 2017 Version</p>

      <p>The Petitions Software Application and Service (hereinafter "Petitions") is provided and maintained by the
        Pupils’ Committee of the European School of Luxembourg 1.</p>
      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
      <p>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.<br>
        We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or
        protect our rights.<br>
        We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our
        services.</p>
      <p>Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.</p>
      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.</p>
      <p>The Pupils’ Committee of the European School of Luxembourg 1 (“Pupils’ Committee”) operates several websites,
        including <a href="http://petitions.pupilscom-esl1.eu">petitions.pupilscom-esl1.eu</a> (“Petitions”). It is
        Pupils’ Committee policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
        websites.</p>
      <h2><a id="Website_Visitors_14"></a>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
        date and time of each visitor request. Pupils’ Committee’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Pupils’ Committee’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Pupils’
        Committee may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on
        trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Pupils’ Committee also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
        addresses for logged in users. Pupils’ Committee only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
      <h2><a id="Gathering_of_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_20"></a>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
      </h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Pupils’ Committee’s websites choose to interact with them in ways that require us to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Pupils’ Committee gathers depends on
        the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account on Petitions to log in
        with Office 365, which provides us with their name and email address, among other data. In each case, Pupils’
        Committee collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
        visitor’s interaction with us. Pupils’ Committee does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
        as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
        that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      <h2><a id="Aggregated_Statistics_24"></a>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>Pupils’ Committee may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Pupils’
        Committee may monitor petitions posted to the Petitions site. Pupils’ Committee may display this information
        publicly or provide it to others. However, Pupils’ Committee does not disclose personally-identifying
        information other than as described below.</p>
      <h2><a id="Protection_of_Certain_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_28"></a>Protection of Certain
        Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Pupils’ Committee discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
        those of its members, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
        to process it on Pupils’ Committee’s behalf or to provide services available at Pupils’ Committee’s websites,
        and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those members, contractors and affiliated
        organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pupils’ Committee’s websites, you consent to
        the transfer of such information to them. Pupils’ Committee will not rent or sell potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its members, contractors
        and affiliated organizations, as described above, Pupils’ Committee discloses potentially personally-identifying
        and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
        request, or when Pupils’ Committee believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
        property or rights of Pupils’ Committee, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a
        Pupils’ Committee website and have supplied your email address, Pupils’ Committee may occasionally send you an
        email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on
        with Pupils’ Committee and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
        support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Pupils’ Committee takes all measures
        reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
      <h2><a id="Cookies_32"></a>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
        browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pupils’ Committee uses cookies to help Pupils’
        Committee identify and track visitors, their usage of Pupils’ Committee website, and their website access
        preferences. Pupils’ Committee visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set
        their browsers to refuse cookies before using Pupils’ Committee’s websites, with the drawback that certain
        features of Pupils’ Committee’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
      <h2><a id="Business_Transfers_36"></a>Business Transfers</h2>
      <p>If Pupils’ Committee, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Pupils’
        Committee goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
        transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
        of Pupils’ Committee may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
      <h2><a id="Privacy_Policy_Changes_40"></a>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Pupils’ Committee may change its Privacy Policy from time to
        time, and in Pupils’ Committee’s sole discretion. Pupils’ Committee encourages visitors to frequently check this
        page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
        Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
